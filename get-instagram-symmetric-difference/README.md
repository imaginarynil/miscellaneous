## Description

A script to obtain the symmetric difference between the "Following" set and the "Follower" set from Instagram. This script helps me to identify people who do not want to make a two-way connection with me. I assume that if I follow person `p` and `p` follows me back, then `p` acknowledges my attempt to make a connection, else, `p` does not want to connect or is not active.

## How to Use

- Open terminal
- Run `main.py` with the directory path to the Instagram data as an argument. For example, `python main.py C:/Users/Daniel/Downloads/instagram-data`.
